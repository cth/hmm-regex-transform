The idea is to transform an HMM given a regular expression.

We need some notion of the transitions and states. We do not 
care about emissions.

I would be neat to do this using CHR. 

So, for instance, we might have that

trans(s1, s2, 0.4) 

Something that transforms a regular expression to a DFA. Reread relevant chapters from Torben Mogensens bog at home..  or possible on screen


CHR rules that convert the original DFA and the new regex DFA to a new DFA.
